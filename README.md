## About Acura

Acura is Honda's luxury vehicle division, established in March 1986. It became the first Japanese luxury automotive brand in North America, paving the way for competitors like Lexus and Infiniti to enter the market later that same decade.

## Company History

- **1986-1990s**: Acura debuted with two models: the Legend and the Integra. The Legend quickly established Acura's reputation for performance and reliability, while the Integra became popular among enthusiasts. The NSX supercar launched in 1990, showcasing Honda's engineering prowess through an all-aluminum body and VTEC technology.

- **2000s**: The brand expanded its lineup with vehicles like the MDX (2001), TSX (2004), and RDX (2007). Acura introduced its Super Handling All-Wheel Drive (SH-AWD) system in 2004, which became a key differentiator for the brand. However, this period also saw criticism regarding Acura's design direction and brand identity.

- **2010s**: Acura began its "Precision Crafted Performance" era, introducing the diamond pentagon grille design in 2015. The second-generation NSX arrived in 2016, featuring a hybrid powertrain and advanced performance technologies. The brand also refreshed its core models including the TLX, RDX, and MDX.

- **2020s**: Acura continues to evolve with a focus on performance and technology. The brand introduced the Type S performance variants for the TLX and MDX, and announced plans for electrification, including the upcoming ZDX electric SUV. The Integra nameplate returned in 2022, marking a renewed commitment to enthusiast-oriented vehicles.
